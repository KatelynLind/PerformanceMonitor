# Performance Monitor

A privacy-preserving performance monitoring system built on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, enabling confidential analysis of sensitive performance data while maintaining complete data privacy.

## üîí Core Concept

**Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** is a revolutionary cryptographic technique that allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without decrypting it. This means:

- Performance metrics remain encrypted throughout the entire analysis process
- Sensitive data never exists in plaintext on the blockchain
- Computational results are obtained without revealing underlying data
- Privacy is maintained while enabling meaningful analytics

## üéØ FHE Contract Confidentiality Performance Monitoring
